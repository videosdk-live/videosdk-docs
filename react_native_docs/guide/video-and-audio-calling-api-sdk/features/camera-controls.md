1. **Enable Camera** - By using `enableWebcam()` function, a participant can publish camera stream to other participants.
2. **Disable Camera** - By using `disableWebcam()` function, a participant can stop publishing camera stream to other participants.
3. **Switch Camera** - By using `changeWebcam()` function, a participant can stream from front / rear camera during the meeting.This function is only applicable for Mobile devices.
