This feature allows participant for establishing connection and getting information from other meetings. Also, a participant will have basic control over other running meetings.

For example, there are two meetings running parallelly Meeting A and Meeting B, in case one of the participant from Meeting A wants to access information of Meeting B without joining it, now this can be achieved by establishing connection between meetings, so that participants of Meeting A and Meeting B will get all the updates from each other.
