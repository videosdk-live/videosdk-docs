# Getting Started - Flutter SDK

Flutter SDK is natively written SDK using Dart. It is compatible with IOS, Android, Web and Desktop apps (MacOs,Windows).

:::important

If you want to use Flutter SDK for Web or Desktop apps (MacOs,Windows), please update SDK version to `1.0.14` or higher. 

:::

## Installing Flutter SDK

Flutter SDK is client for real-time communication for android and ios devices. It inherits the same terminology as all other SDKs does.

### Step 1: Add this package in your flutter project

VideoSDK flutter SDK canbe added using the following command:

```bash
flutter pub add videosdk
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit flutter pub get):

```
dependencies:
  videosdk: ^1.0.x
```

### Step 2: Android Setup

VideoSDK requires you to add following permissions to your app so that it can access the audio and video from the device.

Ensure the following permission is present in your Android Manifest file, located in `<project root>/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
```

If you need to use a Bluetooth device, please add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
```

Also you will need to set your build settings to Java 8, because official WebRTC jar now uses static methods in `EglBase` interface. Just add this to your app level `build.gradle`:

```js
android {
    //...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

###### Update the minimumSdkVersion for android

If necessary, in the same `build.gradle` you will need to increase `minSdkVersion` of `defaultConfig` up to `23` (currently default Flutter generator set it to `16`).

If necessary, in the same `build.gradle` you will need to increase `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` up to `31` (currently default Flutter generator set it to `30`).

### Step 3: IOS Setup

VideoSDK requires you to add following permissions to your app so that it can access the audio and video from the device.

Add the following entry to your `Info.plist` file, located at `<project root>/ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) Camera Usage!</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) Microphone Usage!</string>
```

###### Update the minimum platform version

Update the minimum iOS platform version to `11.0`. You can update it in the `ios/Podfile`.

```js title="Podfile"
platform: ios, "11.0";
```

### Step 4: MacOs Setup

VideoSDK requires you to add following permissions to your app so that it can access the audio and video from the device.

Add the following entry to your `Info.plist` file, located at `<project root>/macos/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) Camera Usage!</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) Microphone Usage!</string>
```

### Step 5: Import it

Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```js
import "package:videosdk/videosdk.dart";
```
