# Leave or End Room

Whenever participant wishes to end their communication in the room, they can simply leave the room.

This guide will provide an overview of how to implement leave or end feature in VideoSDK rooms.

1. **Leave** - By using `leave()` function, only a participant will leave/exit the room, the rest of the room will continue with other participants.
2. **End** - By using `end()` function, room will end for each and every participant. So, use this function according to your use cases.

### Leave And End Room

```js
// Leave the room
room.leave();

// end() method is coming soon in flutter.
```
